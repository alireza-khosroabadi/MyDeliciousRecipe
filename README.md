# My Delicious Recipe App

## Overview

Welcome to **My Delicious Recipe**, a robust Android application meticulously crafted with a focus on Clean Architecture and modern Android development principles. This README serves as your gateway to understanding the project's architecture, technologies employed, and the delightful features that make this app a culinary companion.

## Clean Architecture

**My Delicious Recipe** strictly adheres to the Clean Architecture pattern, a design philosophy emphasizing modularity, separation of concerns, and maintainability. Our architecture comprises distinct layers, each with a well-defined purpose:

### 1. Presentation Layer
   - **UI Components:** Found in the "ui" modules, we leverage the elegance of Jetpack Compose for crafting a modern and intuitive user interface.

### 2. Domain Layer
   - **Domain Logic:** Nestled in the "domain" modules, this layer houses the business logic and use cases, ensuring that the core functionality remains independent of implementation details.

### 3. Data Layer
   - **Data Operations:** In the "data" modules, we handle all data-related operations, including data sources and repositories. Room facilitates local storage, while Retrofit streamlines network operations.

### 4. Dependency Injection
   - **DI Management:** Our "di" modules utilize Hilt for dependency injection, creating a clean and maintainable structure that enhances code readability and testability.

## Project Structure

Navigate the project's structured landscape for a seamless development experience. Key directories include "core" for shared components, "feature" for individual app features like "recipes," and "di" for dependency injection.
