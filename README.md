# Project README

## Overview

Welcome to My Delicious Recipe, a robust Android application built with a focus on Clean Architecture and modern Android development principles. This README provides a comprehensive guide to the project's structure, technologies, and features.

## Project Structure

The project follows the Clean Architecture pattern, promoting modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key directories:

### Core Directory
- **network:** Manages network-related components using Retrofit for seamless API integration.
- **database:** Handles database operations, utilizing Room for local data storage.
- **datastore:** Contains data-related modules, providing a clean separation between data sources.
- **base:** Defines base classes and utilities shared across the application.
- **systemdesign:** Encompasses system-level design elements and configurations.
- **ui:** Houses UI-related components that are shared across multiple features.
- **utility:** Hosts utility classes and helper functions.

### Feature Directories
- **home:** Represents a feature module with sub-modules for UI, domain logic, data, and dependency injection related to the home feature.
- **contacts:** Similar to the home module, encapsulating the contacts feature.

### Home Feature Module Structure

In the context of your Android project's structure, the "home" directory represents a feature module dedicated to a specific functionality or screen in your application. Let's break down the sub-modules within the "home" directory:

1. **home-ui:**
    - This module is responsible for handling the User Interface (UI) components related to the "home" feature. It includes activities, fragments, layouts, and any other UI-related code specific to the home screen.

2. **home-domain:**
    - The "domain" module contains the business logic and rules specific to the "home" feature. It encapsulates the use cases, business rules, repositories interface and any domain-related logic without being concerned about the implementation details.

3. **home-data:**
    - This module deals with data-related operations for the "home" feature. It includes data sources, repositories implementation, and any data-related logic needed to retrieve or manipulate data for the "home" screen.

4. **home-di:**
    - The "di" stands for Dependency Injection. This module manages the dependency injection for the "home" feature. It includes the setup for Hilt (the DI framework you mentioned in your skills) and provides the necessary dependencies for the UI, domain, and data layers within the "home" feature.

By organizing your project in this way, you achieve a modular and clean code architecture. Each module has a specific responsibility, promoting separation of concerns and making it easier to maintain, test, and scale the application. This modular structure also supports code reuse and collaboration among team members working on different aspects of the project.


## Technology Stack

### Dependency Injection
- **Hilt:** Utilized for dependency injection, promoting a clean and maintainable DI structure.

### Database
- **Room:** Employs Room for efficient and structured local data storage.

### Network
- **Retrofit:** Employs Retrofit for efficient and structured network operations.

### UI
- **Jetpack Compose:** Leverages the power of Jetpack Compose for modern and declarative UI development.

### Gradle and Build Logic
- **Build-logic:** Incorporates build logic to streamline dependency management and project configuration.
- **Gradle:** Utilizes Gradle for build automation, ensuring efficient and scalable development.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
